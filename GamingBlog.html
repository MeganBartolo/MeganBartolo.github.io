            Sometimes after long hours of smashing my keyboard and throwing it across the room because my competitive
            games refuse to stop lagging, I feel like winding down. Yet I still feel like playing games. So what now?
            Let me introduce you to the world of cosy games. These are some of my favorites.
            <br>
            My top 3 cosiest games- And why.

            Animal Crossing- Ahh it feels like March 2020 all over again. What was it with this game and mind controlling people to never
            put the switch down? It even got a hold of me! It’s such a relaxing game I love it to bits. (if you ignore
            the hundreds of thousands of financial depth you owe Tom Nook.
            <br> <br>
            Which can be quite stressful saving up for, marking it third on todays list.)

            Stardew Valley- Stardew my beloved. This right here is the magnum opus of all farming simulators.<br>
            It’s packed with lovable villagers along with potential bachelors if you’re in to that sort of thing, 100
            levels of unexplored mines, changing seasons, customization of your farm and character and the obvious one..
            farming! It was difficult putting Stardew Valley in second, but it had to be done.

            Unpacking- And now for my number one spot, no questions asked it HAS to be unpacking.<br>
            This game did something to my brain. As someone who hates the stress of unpacking, cleaning and organizing..
            for some strange reason, this game has me hooked. It has some light plot for you to discover as you go
            through it, and there’s quite a lot to learn about its main character if you tend to be an observant person.
            I enjoyed neatly sorting everything in to its place greatly and could only wish that I would put that same
            energy in to my own home. This game is definitely deserving of my number one recommendation if anyone ever
            needs unwinding after a stressful day.
            <br><br>
            I hope anyone looking for game recommendations found this helpful :).
