            I spent the last two weeks in Egypt. Specifically in Giza. Here’s how that went.

            I’ll start off by saying.. yes it’s as hot in Egypt as they say it is. As much as I loved the trip as a
            whole, I
            really did miss my air conditioning at home.<br>
            What did an average day in Egypt look like for us?<br>
            We got to see some of the most beautiful (and some of the creepiest) historical artefacts today. The
            most noticeable of all of course being..<br><br>

            The pyramids! Duh.
            Here’s a picture my sister took of me and the family riding camels. I almost fell off at one point!

            Not only did we see the Pyramids we also got to see the the Great Sphinx of Giza in person. It was so much
            bigger in person, I couldn’t believe my eyes.

            This was definitely our most awesome trip yet. Can’t wait to update you all on our next trip to Greece. I
            hope Marsha picks my story for her next giveaway. Bye guys!
