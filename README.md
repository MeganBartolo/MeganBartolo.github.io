-My website design assignment-

With research, I decided to start my github from scratch and create an entirely new one using my new knowledge.

I also included more comments in my coding this time, in order to further understand what I am coding.

Since I started from scratch there aren't many changes, The only changes are the adding new files by dragging and dropping them in to github. 
I then created pages using github, and made the website live for everyone to see. Now I am adding a README in order to share basic notes of my process on github.
